def calc_noise(file_path: str, agent_number: int) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate noise based on seeds stored in a CSV file for a specific agent.

    This function reads a CSV file containing seeds for each collaborator by round,
    generates noise vectors for each round, and applies quantization if enabled in 
    the run configuration. It differentiates the noise for the specific agent from others.

    Parameters:
        file_path : str
            The path to the CSV file containing the seeds.
        agent_number : int
            The index of the current agent for whom the noise is being calculated.

    Returns:
        dict
            A dictionary with round numbers as keys and noise vectors as values.

    Example:
        >>> noises = calc_noise('path/to/seeds.csv', 2)
        >>> print(noises[1])  # Noise vector for round 1
